# Alarm-System
A project to control Alarm with raspberry pi and python code
I used 12V Siren and Soild State Realy because PI can't generate 12V
The code Search about "Amplitude=" in text file called scanLog.txt if there is "0" after it nothing happen but if this value became "1"
the alarm will produce.
